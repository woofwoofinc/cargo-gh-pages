Cargo GitHub Pages
==================
Forked from the [cargo-release] project by [Ning Sun]. This is the GitHub Pages
functionality without the full release management.

[cargo-release]: https://github.com/sunng87/cargo-release
[Ning Sun]: https://github.com/sunng87


Using Cargo GitHub Pages
------------------------
Install Cargo GitHub Pages in a Git managed Cargo-based Rust project using:

    cargo install cargo-gh-pages

Generate RustDoc and push to GitHub Pages branch using:

    cargo gh-pages --upload-doc

This will generate RustDoc and commit the doc directory to the `gh-pages`
branch of the repository. If GitHub Pages are enabled on the repository then you
will be able to access your RustDoc at
https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.

WARNING: This will override your existed gh-pages branch, use at your own risk.

Options for Cargo GitHub Pages can be set in `Cargo.toml` under the custom
section `package.metadata.gh-pages`:

* `sign-commit`: bool, use GPG to sign git commits. Default false.
* `push-remote`: string, git remote for push. Default "origin".
* `doc-branch`: string, default branch to push docs. Default "gh-pages".
* `doc-commit-message`: string, a commit message template for doc import.
  Default "(cargo-gh-pages) Generate docs.".

```toml
[package.metadata.gh-pages] 
sign-commit = false
push-remote = "origin"
doc-branch = "gh-pages"
doc-commit-message = "(cargo-gh-pages) Generate docs."
```

Include the `--dry-run` option to print all the commands to execute instead of
performing the generate and upload.

```
$ cargo gh-pages --dry-run
Building and exporting docs.
cargo doc --no-deps
cd target/doc/
git init
cd -
cd target/doc/
git add .
cd -
cd target/doc/
git commit  -am (cargo-gh-pages) Generate docs.
cd -
cd target/doc/
git push -f git@github.com:woofwoofinc/cargo-gh-pages.git master:gh-pages
cd -
```


Developing Cargo GitHub Pages
-----------------------------
Install the [Rust] development tools on your system with [rustup] if they are
not already available. Then build and test the project using:

    cargo test

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org
[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs

Install a development version of the plugin locally from latest source using:

    cargo install

Then test with a dry run:

    cargo gh-pages --dry-run


Docker
------
A [Docker] container definition is provided with installations of the tools
used to develop Cargo GitHub Pages. To use the container, first install Docker
if not already available and start a Docker terminal. Then create the container
by running the following build at the top level of the repository source tree:

    docker build --rm=true -t cargo-gh-pages .

[Docker]: http://docker.io

Once built, an interactive shell can be run in the container using:

    docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/cargo-gh-pages" --workdir=/cargo-gh-pages cargo-gh-pages /bin/bash

The current working directory from the host machine is available as the current
directory in the container so it is possible to build and test the library as
described earlier.

    cargo test


Travis
------
Cargo GitHub Pages is continuously integrated on [Travis CI].

To update encrypted credentials in the `.travis.yml` file, use the
[Travis command line tool].

    gem install travis

For instance, to update the Slack notification credential:

    travis encrypt "woofwoofinc:<credential>" --add notifications.slack

[Travis CI]: https://travis-ci.org
[Travis command line tool]: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys


Running Clippy Lints
--------------------
[Clippy] is a Rust linter. Currently it has to be run manually since Cargo
GitHub Pages targets Rust stable and Clippy requires Rust nightly. Switching
versions is easy with `rustup` - use the following to lint the repository:

    rustup run nightly cargo clippy
