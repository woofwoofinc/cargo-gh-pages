Tutorial
--------

1 Install Cargo Sphinx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If not already available, start by installing the Cargo Sphinx extension.

.. code:: bash

    cargo install cargo-sphinx


2 Make a New Cargo Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Begin in a new cargo project.

.. code:: bash

    cargo new cargo-sphinx-tutorial
    cd cargo-sphinx-tutorial

There will be a ``Cargo.toml`` and skeleton Rust ``src`` directory. We are going
to add a new Sphinx project at ``docs`` to document this Rust project.


3 Sphinx QuickStart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use the sphinx-quickstart tool to get started with Sphinx.

.. code:: bash

    $ sphinx-quickstart
    Welcome to the Sphinx 1.4.6 quickstart utility.

    Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
    accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

This tool asks a series of questions and configures a Sphinx layout and project
for the answers. The first question is where to put the project files. By
default, Cargo Sphinx assumes the Sphinx files are located in ``docs``. This
can be overridden by configuration but it's easier to use the default if we
can.

.. code:: bash

    Enter the root path for documentation.
    > Root path for the documentation [.]: docs

Cargo Sphinx current assumes there is no separate build directory for Sphinx
output, i.e. output is to ``_build`` in the same directory as the source
documentation files.

Answer ``n`` to separate source and build directories when asked.

.. code:: bash

    You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
    Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
    "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
    > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]:

This is followed by a series of questions that don't matter for Cargo Sphinx,
complete them as you prefer.

.. code:: bash

    Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
    for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
    files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
    > Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
    
    The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
    > Project name: My Cargo Sphinx Project
    > Author name(s): Me!
    
    Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
    software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
    Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
    something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
    just set both to the same value.
    > Project version: 1.0
    > Project release [1.0]:
    
    If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
    you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
    translate text that it generates into that language.
    
    For a list of supported codes, see
    http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html#confval-language.
    > Project language [en]: 
    
    The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
    or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
    > Source file suffix [.rst]: 
    
    One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
    "contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
    of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
    document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
    > Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
    
    Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
    > Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: 

The Sphinx quickstart asks about whether to include a number of extensions.
Mostly these depend on whether you will use the functionality they support.

It is a good idea to include the githubpages extension even though Cargo Sphinx
provides support for generating ``.nojekyll`` files also. These are needed so
the GitHub Pages Jekyll processor doesn't delete files needed by the Sphinx
output. (githubpages is the last extension in the block below.)

.. code:: bash

    Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
    > autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: 
    > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: 
    > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: 
    > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: 
    > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: 
    > imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]: 
    > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: 
    > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: 
    > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: 
    > githubpages: create .nojekyll file to publish the document on GitHub pages (y/n) [n]: y

Next, Sphinx quickstart asks whether a Makefile should be generated. Usually
this is a convenience but is necessary in the case of Cargo Sphinx.

Answer yes to creating a Makefile. The Windows command file is up to you.

.. code:: bash

    A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
    only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
    directly.
    > Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: y
    > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: 

Finally, Sphinx quickstart generates the Sphinx source files under ``docs``.

.. code:: bash

    Creating file docs/conf.py.
    Creating file docs/index.rst.
    Creating file docs/Makefile.
    Creating file docs/make.bat.
    
    Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.
    
    You should now populate your master file docs/index.rst and create other documentation
    source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
       make builder
    where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.


4 Run Cargo Sphinx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We are now ready to run Cargo Sphinx.

.. code:: bash

    cargo sphinx

The generated site can be inspected by loading ``docs/_build/html/index.html``
in a browser.

You are now all setup and ready to document!
